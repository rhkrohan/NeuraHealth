## Problem Statement

In today's healthcare environment, patients often face significant delays and high costs when seeking medical diagnoses, particularly in the United States. Long wait times for doctor appointments and expensive consultations make timely medical care difficult for many individuals. Additionally, many non-serious cases unnecessarily burden healthcare providers, leading to inefficient use of medical resources.

Our AI Healthcare System aims to address these challenges by providing fast, cost-effective, and accessible preliminary diagnoses for critical health conditions, starting with brain tumors, diabetes, and pneumonia. The system is designed to:

- Reduce the time and expense associated with traditional diagnostic processes.
- Screen out non-serious cases, allowing healthcare professionals to focus on patients needing urgent care.
- Assist doctors by instantly providing examination results, enhancing decision-making and improving patient outcomes.

This project is an evolving concept, with plans to integrate additional diagnostic capabilities and expand the system's functionality to serve a broader range of medical needs.
